### [1] Difficult Customer
A: Good evening. My name is Fabio, I'll be your waiter for tonight. May I take your order?

B: No, **I'm still working on it**. This menu is not even in English. What's good here?

A: For you sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

A: Does it come with **coke and fries**?

B:It comes with either soup or salad and a **complimentary** glass of wine, Sir.

A: **I'll go with** the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

B: Excellent choice, your order will be ready soon.

A: How soon is soon?  

B: Twenty minutes?

B: But there must be some mistake; my reservation was for a standard room.

A: Are you sure? Let me double check .

B: Yeah...Here, this is my confirmation number.

A: You're right Mr. Roberts, there seems to be a **mix-up**, unfortunately we're **overbooked** at the moment.

B: Presidential suite baby!

### [4] I need an assistant
A: ... like I told you before, we just don't have the **resources** to hire you an assistant. ... 

B: I understand that, but the fact is we're **understaffed**. 

A: **The timing is just not right**. The economy is bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff. 

B: Yeah, I guess you're right... here's an idea, what if we hire an intern? She would take some of the **weight off my shoulders**. 

A: She? 

B: Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could **give me a hand** with some of these projects and we could **keep our costs down**. 

A: That sounds reasonable... let me see what I can do. 

A: Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant. 

B: OK, great! Let's meet her! 

C: Hi, I'm Adam. 

B: Oh... hi... I'm Tony...

A: Oh no! Look at that line! It must be **a mile long**! **There's no way** I'm waiting for another two hours. 

B: Honey... don't... 

C: Hey man, the end of the line is over there. 

A: Yeah... 

C: No seriously, I was here first, and you can't **cut in line** like this. 

A: Says who? 

C: I do! 

A: So **sue me**! 

C: Alright... that's it...

---
### [6] Road Trip
A: So, are we all ready to go?

B: Got it! Did you **fill up the tank**? 

A: Yup, it's all set. 

B: You're sure we're not forgetting anything? 

A: I'm sure... **we've got all our bases covered**.

### [7] Virus
A: Oh great! This stupid computer **froze** again! That's the third time today! Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC? **It's acting up again**. It must have a virus or something. 

B: Just give me a second; **I'll be right up**. 

B: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and **it turns out that** you have a lot of **infected files**! 

A: But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus. 

B: Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly; yours wasn't **up to date**, that's probably what was causing your problems. 

A: Ok. Anything else? 

B: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer! 

A: Um yeah... Sorry about that.

---
### [8] What's your name again
A: Nick! **How's it going**? 

B: Oh, hey... 

A: What are you doing in this neighbourhood? Do you live around here? 

B: Actually, my office is right around the corner. 

A: It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment. 

B: Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting. You know, **I'm in a bit of a hurry**, but here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion. 

A: Sure, you still have my **contact details**, right ? 

B: You know what, this is really embarrassing, but your name has just **slipped my mind**. Can you remind me?

A: Oh...  **I can't hear a thing**! Excuse me, can you **keep it down**? 

C: Sure, sorry 'bout that!

A: All right, people. We're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales, and we need to do it NOW! I want concrete solutions. How do you plan to **drive sales**... Roger? 

B: Well, in fact, we're the most expensive **in the market**, so maybe we need to lower our prices to **match the competitors**? 

A: Lower our prices? Not very creative. **It'll never fly** with Swan. What kind of thinking is that? Geez. Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie? 

C: Um, perhaps, um, a **promotion**. Maybe a two-for-one offer, or something like that! 

A: What? That's the same thing. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think! The CEO **will be here any minute**. 

D: Do we have any ideas yet? 

C: Yes Mr. Swan, we were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive. 

D: A two-for-one promotion? Hmm. I kind of like the sound of that. **It sounds like something we should consider**. 

A: Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking! In fact, that's a **brilliant** idea! I'm glad we thought of that. Very creative.

A: Really? What's he like? You have to **fill me in**. 

B: Actually, he's a bit strange. I don't know... I've just got **a bad feeling** about him. 

A: Really? Why? 

B: Well, yesterday I brought over a **housewarming gift**, but Armand started acting really **weird**, and then he practically **kicked me out**! I tried to, sort of, peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look. The whole thing really **creeped me out**! 

A: Well, **you'll never guess what I saw** this morning. A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost looked like a coffin! 

B: You see! Why would he... 

C: Hello ladies... 

A: Ah, Armand! You **scared the heck out of me**! This is my friend Doris. 

C: A pleasure to meet you... If you are not doing anything tonight, I would like to have you both for dinner.I mean... I would like to have you both over for dinner.

A: Let's see... These numbers are **off the charts**! What's going on here! 

B: Well, um, sir, the company **expenditures** on entertainment and travel are **out of control**. Look at these bills for example. Just this month we've paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges! 

A: OK, thank you. I'll look into it. 

B: The list goes on and on. Here, this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments! 

A: Thank you; that will be all. I'll **take care of** it.

B: I see...... 

A: Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments, I've got to pay my **mortgage**; and **on top of all that**, I have to pay my son's college **tuition**. 

B: So you're asking for a **loan**. 

A: Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

B: **Are you nuts**! I'm not going to run a red light! 

A: Whatever. Just turn right here. ... The freeway will be packed at this hour... **let's take a side street**. Go on! Get out of our way! Move, move! 

B: What's your problem! Geez. **Having a fit** is not going to help!

Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed **bailout** of the auto manufacturing industry! Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, Action 5 news. Can you tell us what's happening? 

B: Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an **injustice**! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop! We're here to show the government that we don't like the way that they're spending our tax dollars! 

A: Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry? 

B: It's an absolute **outrage**, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers' money to the auto industry. These are companies that have been **mismanaged** and are now nearly **bankrupt**. 

A: I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans. 

B: That maybe true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job, but how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars? And then, they **have the nerve to** fly to Washington in private jets! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars! And they're asking for money! That is just not right! 

A: Good point. This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington D. C., back to you, Tom.

B: Hey doc. Well, I think I might need glasses. I'm getting headaches, and I really **struggle** to see things that are far away. But I have always had **20/20 vision**. 

A: Sounds like you may be **far-sighted**. OK, then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.  

B: Mmm... X, E, R, 3, a question mark, and I can't quite **make out** the other symbol but I think it's the peace sign. 

A: Wow, Arthur! You're as blind as a bat!

I also have to **oversee** daily operation of quality control for the entire East coast, that alone means I have 1500 employees under me.

D: And what about you, Arthur? **What do you do for a living**? 

B: Oh, I'm a Top Gun pilot!

C: Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy! Can you believe that? 

A: It's Christmas Eve and I have all these Presents to deliver! Where is your Christmas spirit? What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their stockings? 

B: Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking zone, you were speeding, and you have no ID!

C: Actually, **I'm not all that crazy about** Italian food; I'm **in the mood for** something a bit lighter. 

A: In that case, I know a great little **bistro**. They make a really **tasty** seafood platter; the fish is outstanding. 

B: It sounds fantastic, but I'm **allergic** to seafood, so... 

A: Okay, well, let me think... Oh, I know this great little place. It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches. **You gotta give them a try**. 

C: Ella, you took me there last time I visited, and I got **food poisoning**, remember?

---
### [25] Planning For The Worst
A: Well, right, **let's move to our next order of business**, as many of you are aware, in recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue. And it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu **contingency plan**. 

B: Basically, **we need to come up with a clear plan**; we need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain **critical** business functions in case a **pandemic** strikes. 

A: So, what I'd like to do is: first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan; Ralph, I'd like you to **head up** this project. 

C: Sure, no problem. What issues do you want me to consider? 

B: Well, let's see, there are a few points we need to be thinking about... first, I'll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an **outbreak** might have. 

A: You'll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected; think of ways to reduce employee-customer contact, perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home. 

C: I guess you'll need me to **forecast** employee absences as well, right? And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients. Hey, what about vaccines? Should we be thinking about getting **vaccines** for our employees? 

A: Exactly right. So, **I'll leave this to you**, and we'll review the draft plan in two weeks. Okay, so, anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?

---
### [26] New Year Resolution
A: So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution? I've decided to go on a diet.

B: I've heard this one before. 

A: But this time I'm going to **stick to it**. I really **mean it**! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time! 

B: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see. 

A: Thanks, honey, that was a great meal. I'm **stuffed**. Do we have any chips left?

---
### [27] Asking for Time Off
A: Mr. McKenna, **do you have a second**? I need to talk to you about something. 

B: Sure, Liv, what can I do for you? 

A: Well, I was just wondering... you see, I know I've used up all my **vacation days** this year, but my sister is getting married, and the wedding is overseas, and, well... 

B: You wanna take some time off, is that right? 

A: Well, sir, I was just hoping that I might be able to take some **unpaid leave** this year. 

B: What dates are you planning on taking off? I'll need at least two months **notice**, so that I can plan for your absence. 

A: I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . **Would you be okay with that?** 

B: Well, I guess so.

### [28] Daily Life - I'm Sorry, I Love You II
A: I'm so **relieved** that your ankle wasn't broken! I feel just awful about this whole thing. I wanna **make it up to you**. Let me take you out to dinner tonight. **My treat**.

A: Perfect! 

B: Thank you for such a lovely evening! The food was amazing, and I had a great time. 

A: Me too. You look so beautiful tonight! I wish this night would never end. There's something I have to tell you... 

B: What is it? 

A: I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other **ordinary** day, but I was wrong. **A twist of fate** brought us together. I crashed into your life and you into mine, and this may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you, Monica.

### [29] Investing in Emerging Markets
A: Dad, I'd like to borrow some money. 

B: Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? five bucks? 

A: Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna get into the market. You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the **inevitable** recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity. This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my **nest egg**. 

B: I don't know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don't know if you're aware son, but there has been a lot of **turmoil** in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how **the proposed stimulus package** will impact the economy. There's just too much instability. I wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate. 

A: But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are **emerging** markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the **aggregate demand** for consumer goods presents an amazing wealth generating opportunity. 

B: Come on, son, you're looking at this too naively, the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point. 

A: Fine, then! If that's the way you feel, so be it. But you're losing out on a great opportunity here. I'm going to go **hit up** Mum for the cash.

### [30] Daily Life - New Guy in Town II

C: No, don't worry about it; I'll take care of everything. I'll see you tonight. Come with an appetite... I know I will! 

B: I don't want go over to his place for dinner! He gives me the creeps! Why on earth did you accept? 

A: Oh come on Ellen, it will be nice to get to know him. Besides, he's new to the neighborhood, and it would be rude to decline his invitation. 

B: I guess so... You always rope me into things like this! 

C: Ladies! Thank you for coming! You look delicious... I mean beautiful. Please come in. 

A: Oh Oh Armand! You are too kind! 

B: How did I get myself into this...
