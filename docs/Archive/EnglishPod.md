### [1] Difficult Customer
A: Good evening. My name is Fabio, I'll be your waiter for tonight. May I take your order?

B: No, **I'm still working on it**. This menu is not even in English. What's good here?

A: For you sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

A: Does it come with **coke and fries**?

B:It comes with either soup or salad and a **complimentary** glass of wine, Sir.

A: **I'll go with** the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

B: Excellent choice, your order will be ready soon.

B: But there must be some mistake; my reservation was for a standard room.

A: Are you sure? Let me double check .

B: Yeah...Here, this is my confirmation number.

A: You're right Mr. Roberts, there seems to be a **mix-up**, unfortunately we're **overbooked** at the moment.

B: Presidential suite baby!

### [4] I need an assistant
A: ... like I told you before, we just don't have the **resources** to hire you an assistant. ... 

B: I understand that, but the fact is we're **understaffed**. 

A: **The timing is just not right**. The economy is bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff. 

B: Yeah, I guess you're right... here's an idea, what if we hire an intern? She would take some of the **weight off my shoulders**. 

A: She? 

B: Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could **give me a hand** with some of these projects and we could **keep our costs down**. 

A: That sounds reasonable... let me see what I can do. 

A: Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

C: Hi, I'm Adam. 

B: Oh... hi... I'm Tony...

A: Oh no! Look at that line! It must be **a mile long**! **There's no way** I'm waiting for another two hours. 

B: Honey... don't... 

C: Hey man, the end of the line is over there. 

A: Yeah... 

C: No seriously, I was here first, and you can't **cut in line** like this. 

A: Says who? 

C: I do! 

A: So **sue me**! 

C: Alright... that's it...

---
### [6] Road Trip
A: So, are we all ready to go?

A: Yup, it's all set. 

B: You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

A: Oh great! This stupid computer **froze** again! That's the third time today! Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC? **It's acting up again**. It must have a virus or something. 

B: Just give me a second; **I'll be right up**. 

B: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and **it turns out that** you have a lot of **infected files**! 

A: But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus. 

B: Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly; yours wasn't **up to date**, that's probably what was causing your problems. 

A: Ok. Anything else? 

B: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer! 

A: Um yeah... Sorry about that.

---

A: Nick! **How's it going**? 

B: Oh, hey... 

A: What are you doing in this neighbourhood? Do you live around here? 

B: Actually, my office is right around the corner. 

A: It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment. 

B: Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting. You know, **I'm in a bit of a hurry**, but here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion. 

A: Sure, you still have my **contact details**, right ?

B: Well, in fact, we're the most expensive **in the market**, so maybe we need to lower our prices to **match the competitors**? 

A: Lower our prices? Not very creative. **It'll never fly** with Swan. What kind of thinking is that? Geez. Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie? 

C: Um, perhaps, um, a **promotion**. Maybe a two-for-one offer, or something like that! 

A: What? That's the same thing. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think! The CEO **will be here any minute**. 

D: Do we have any ideas yet? 

C: Yes Mr. Swan, we were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive. 

D: A two-for-one promotion? Hmm. I kind of like the sound of that. **It sounds like something we should consider**. 

A: Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking! In fact, that's a **brilliant** idea! I'm glad we thought of that. Very creative.

A: Really? What's he like? You have to **fill me in**. 

B: Actually, he's a bit strange. I don't know... I've just got **a bad feeling** about him. 

A: Really? Why? 

B: Well, yesterday I brought over a **housewarming gift**, but Armand started acting really **weird**, and then he practically **kicked me out**! I tried to, sort of, peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look. The whole thing really **creeped me out**! 

A: Well, **you'll never guess what I saw** this morning. A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost looked like a coffin! 

B: You see! Why would he... 

C: Hello ladies... 

A: Ah, Armand! You **scared the heck out of me**! This is my friend Doris. 

C: A pleasure to meet you... If you are not doing anything tonight, I would like to have you both for dinner.I mean... I would like to have you both over for dinner.

A: Let's see... These numbers are **off the charts**! What's going on here! 

B: Well, um, sir, the company **expenditures** on entertainment and travel are **out of control**. Look at these bills for example. Just this month we've paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges! 

A: OK, thank you. I'll look into it. 

B: The list goes on and on. Here, this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments! 

A: Thank you; that will be all. I'll **take care of** it.

B: **Are you nuts**! I'm not going to run a red light! 

A: Whatever. Just turn right here. ... The freeway will be packed at this hour... **let's take a side street**. Go on! Get out of our way! Move, move! 

B: What's your problem! Geez. **Having a fit** is not going to help!

Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed **bailout** of the auto manufacturing industry! Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, Action 5 news. Can you tell us what's happening? 

B: Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an **injustice**! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop! We're here to show the government that we don't like the way that they're spending our tax dollars! 

A: Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry? 

B: It's an absolute **outrage**, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers' money to the auto industry. These are companies that have been **mismanaged** and are now nearly **bankrupt**. 

A: I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans. 

B: That maybe true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job, but how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars? And then, they **have the nerve to** fly to Washington in private jets! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars! And they're asking for money! That is just not right! 

A: Good point. This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington D. C., back to you, Tom.

A: Sounds like you may be **far-sighted**. OK, then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

B: Oh, I'm a Top Gun pilot!

C: Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy! Can you believe that? 

A: It's Christmas Eve and I have all these Presents to deliver! Where is your Christmas spirit? What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their stockings? 

B: Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking zone, you were speeding, and you have no ID!

C: Actually, **I'm not all that crazy about** Italian food; I'm **in the mood for** something a bit lighter. 

A: In that case, I know a great little **bistro**. They make a really **tasty** seafood platter; the fish is outstanding. 

B: It sounds fantastic, but I'm **allergic** to seafood, so... 

A: Okay, well, let me think... Oh, I know this great little place. It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches. **You gotta give them a try**. 

C: Ella, you took me there last time I visited, and I got **food poisoning**, remember?

---
### [25] Planning For The Worst
A: Well, right, **let's move to our next order of business**, as many of you are aware, in recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue. And it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu **contingency plan**. 

B: Basically, **we need to come up with a clear plan**; we need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain **critical** business functions in case a **pandemic** strikes. 

A: So, what I'd like to do is: first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan; Ralph, I'd like you to **head up** this project. 

C: Sure, no problem. What issues do you want me to consider? 

B: Well, let's see, there are a few points we need to be thinking about... first, I'll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an **outbreak** might have. 

A: You'll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected; think of ways to reduce employee-customer contact, perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home. 

C: I guess you'll need me to **forecast** employee absences as well, right? And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients. Hey, what about vaccines? Should we be thinking about getting **vaccines** for our employees? 

A: Exactly right. So, **I'll leave this to you**, and we'll review the draft plan in two weeks. Okay, so, anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?

### [26] New Year Resolution

B: I've heard this one before. 

A: But this time I'm going to **stick to it**. I really **mean it**! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time! 

B: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see. 

A: Thanks, honey, that was a great meal. I'm **stuffed**. Do we have any chips left?

### [27] Asking for Time Off
A: Mr. McKenna, **do you have a second**? I need to talk to you about something. 

B: Sure, Liv, what can I do for you? 

A: Well, I was just wondering... you see, I know I've used up all my **vacation days** this year, but my sister is getting married, and the wedding is overseas, and, well... 

B: You wanna take some time off, is that right? 

A: Well, sir, I was just hoping that I might be able to take some **unpaid leave** this year. 

B: What dates are you planning on taking off? I'll need at least two months **notice**, so that I can plan for your absence. 

A: I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . **Would you be okay with that?** 

B: Well, I guess so.

### [28] Daily Life - I'm Sorry, I Love You II
A: I'm so **relieved** that your ankle wasn't broken! I feel just awful about this whole thing. I wanna **make it up to you**. Let me take you out to dinner tonight. **My treat**.

A: Perfect! 

B: Thank you for such a lovely evening! The food was amazing, and I had a great time. 

A: Me too. You look so beautiful tonight! I wish this night would never end. There's something I have to tell you... 

B: What is it? 

A: I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other **ordinary** day, but I was wrong. **A twist of fate** brought us together. I crashed into your life and you into mine, and this may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you, Monica.

### [29] Investing in Emerging Markets
A: Dad, I'd like to borrow some money. 

B: Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? five bucks? 

A: Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna get into the market. You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the **inevitable** recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity. This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my **nest egg**. 

B: I don't know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don't know if you're aware son, but there has been a lot of **turmoil** in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how **the proposed stimulus package** will impact the economy. There's just too much instability. I wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate. 

A: But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are **emerging** markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the **aggregate demand** for consumer goods presents an amazing wealth generating opportunity. 

B: Come on, son, you're looking at this too naively, the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point. 

A: Fine, then! If that's the way you feel, so be it. But you're losing out on a great opportunity here. I'm going to go **hit up** Mum for the cash.

### [30] Daily Life - New Guy in Town II

C: No, don't worry about it; I'll take care of everything. I'll see you tonight. Come with an appetite... I know I will! 

B: I don't want go over to his place for dinner! He gives me the creeps! Why on earth did you accept? 

A: Oh come on Ellen, it will be nice to get to know him. Besides, he's new to the neighborhood, and it would be rude to decline his invitation. 

B: I guess so... You always rope me into things like this! 

C: Ladies! Thank you for coming! You look delicious... I mean beautiful. Please come in. 

A: Oh Oh Armand! You are too kind! 

B: How did I get myself into this...

### [47] Just In Time Strategy
A: I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan. As I'm sure you're all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global financial crisis, we're obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods. We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies. So, we've outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy. 

B: We have two basic points that we want to focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our lead time. 

C: Why would want to do that? I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on. 

B: Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better overall efficiency. 

A: Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company. 

C: I see... That makes sense. 

B: The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong. 

C: I'm with you on this one. It's essential that we reduce these errors; we've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes. 

A: Exactly. Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action. First... (fade out)
