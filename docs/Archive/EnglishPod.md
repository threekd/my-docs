A: Does it come with **coke and fries**?

A:It comes with either soup or salad and a **complimentary** glass of wine, Sir.

A: All right R.O.B.E.R.T.S... Oh, Mr. Roberts we've been expecting you... and here is your keycard to the presidential suite.

A:But there must be some mistake; my reservation was for a standard room.

A: Are you sure? Let me double check .

A:Yeah...Here, this is my confirmation number.

A: You're right Mr. Roberts, there seems to be a **mix-up**, unfortunately we're **overbooked** at the moment.

A:Presidential suite baby!

### [4] I need an assistant
A: ... like I told you before, we just don't have the **resources** to hire you an assistant. ... 

A: I understand that, but the fact is we're **understaffed**. 

A: **The timing is just not right**. The economy is bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff. 

A: Yeah, I guess you're right... here's an idea, what if we hire an intern? She would take some of the **weight off my shoulders**. 

A: She? 

A: Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could **give me a hand** with some of these projects and we could **keep our costs down**. 

A: That sounds reasonable... let me see what I can do. 

A: Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant. 

A: OK, great! Let's meet her! 

B: Hi, I'm Adam. 

A: Oh... hi... I'm Tony...

A: Oh no! Look at that line! It must be **a mile long**! **There's no way** I'm waiting for another two hours. 

A: Honey... don't... 

B: Hey man, the end of the line is over there. 

A: Yeah... 

B: No seriously, I was here first, and you can't **cut in line** like this. 

A: Says who? 

B: I do! 

A: So **sue me**! 

B: Alright... that's it...

### [6] Road Trip
A: So, are we all ready to go? 

A: Yup, I think so. **The car's packed**; we have **munchies** and music, and the map's in the car. 

A: Did you get the camera? 

A: Got it! Did you **fill up the tank**? 

A: Yup, it's all set. 

A: You're sure we're not forgetting anything? 

A: I'm sure... **we've got all our bases covered**. 

A: Well... **let's get going** then! I love road trips! 

A: Um... do you think we can make a **pit stop**? 

A: But we've only been on the road for ten minutes. 

A: I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

### [7] Virus
A: Oh great! This stupid computer **froze** again! That's the third time today! Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC? **It's acting up again**. It must have a virus or something. 

A: Just give me a second; **I'll be right up**. 

A: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and **it turns out that** you have a lot of **infected files**! 

A: But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus. 

A: Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly; 
yours wasn't **up to date**, that's probably what was causing your problems. 

A: Ok. Anything else? 

A: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer! 

A: Um yeah... Sorry about that.

### [8] What's your name again
A: Nick! **How's it going**? 

A: Oh, hey... 

A: What are you doing in this neighbourhood? Do you live around here? 

A: Actually, my office is right around the corner. 

A: It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment. 

A: Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting. You know, **I'm in a bit of a hurry**, but here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion. 

A: Sure, you still have my **contact details**, right ? 

A: You know what, this is really embarrassing, but your name has just **slipped my mind**. Can you remind me?

A: Oh...  **I can't hear a thing**! Excuse me, can you **keep it down**? 

B: Sure, sorry 'bout that! 

A: Someone's phone is ringing! 

A: Honey, I think it's your phone. Did you forget to **switch it off**?

A: All right, people. We're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales, and we need to do it NOW! I want concrete solutions. How do you plan to **drive sales**... Roger? 

A: Well, in fact, we're the most expensive **in the market**, so maybe we need to lower our prices to **match the competitors**? 

A: Lower our prices? Not very creative. **It'll never fly** with Swan. What kind of thinking is that? Geez. Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie? 

B: Um, perhaps, um, a **promotion**. Maybe a two-for-one offer, or something like that! 

A: What? That's the same thing. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think! The CEO **will be here any minute**. 

D: Do we have any ideas yet? 

B: Yes Mr. Swan, we were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive. 

D: A two-for-one promotion? Hmm. I kind of like the sound of that. **It sounds like something we should consider**. 

A: Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking! In fact, that's a **brilliant** idea! I'm glad we thought of that. Very creative.

A: Really? What's he like? You have to **fill me in**. 

A: Actually, he's a bit strange. I don't know... I've just got **a bad feeling** about him. 

A: Really? Why? 

A: Well, yesterday I brought over a **housewarming gift**, but Armand started acting really **weird**, and then he practically **kicked me out**! I tried to, sort of, peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look. The whole thing really **creeped me out**! 

A: Well, **you'll never guess what I saw** this morning. A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost looked like a coffin! 

A: You see! Why would he... 

B: Hello ladies... 

A: Ah, Armand! You **scared the heck out of me**! This is my friend Doris. 

B: A pleasure to meet you... If you are not doing anything tonight, I would like to have you both for dinner.I mean... I would like to have you both over for dinner.

A: Sure that's fine. Here is the list of all the things you need to get. Don't forget anything! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home? 

A: Hey, honey I'm back. Wow, the house looks really good!

A: OK, so now the last point on our agenda. Jill, let's **go over** the profit and loss statement.

A: Let's see... These numbers are **off the charts**! What's going on here! 

A: Well, um, sir, the company **expenditures** on entertainment and travel are **out of control**. Look at these bills for example. Just this month we've paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges! 

A: OK, thank you. I'll look into it. 

A: The list goes on and on. Here, this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments! 

A: Thank you; that will be all. I'll **take care of** it.

### [18] Protest!
A: This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D. C. where a protest has **broken out**. Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed **bailout** of the auto manufacturing industry! Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, Action 5 news. Can you tell us what's happening? 

B: Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an **injustice**! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop! We're there to show the government that we don't like the way that they're spending our tax dollars! 

A: Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry? 

B: It's an absolute **outrage**, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers' money to the auto industry. These are companies that have been **mismanaged** and are now nearly **bankrupt**. 

A: I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans. 

B: That maybe true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job, but how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars? And then, they **have the nerve to** fly to Washington in private jets! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars! And they're asking for money! That is just not right! 

A: Good point. This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington D. C., back to you, Tom.
