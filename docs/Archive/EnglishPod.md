### [1] Difficult Customer
A: Good evening. My name is Fabio, I'll be your waiter for tonight. May I take your order?

A: For you sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

B: Does it come with **coke and fries**?

A:It comes with either soup or salad and a **complimentary** glass of wine, Sir.

B: **I'll go with** the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

A: Excellent choice, your order will be ready soon.

B: How soon is soon?  

A: Twenty minutes?

B: You know what? I'll just go **grab** a burger across the street.

A: Hi, Julie, how are you?

B: Actually, I’m feeling **quite ill** today.

A: I’m sorry to hear that. What’s wrong?

### [3] Hotel Upgrade
A: Good afternoon. What can I do for you?

B:I'd like to check in please. I have a reservation **under the name** Anthony Roberts.

A: All right R.O.B.E.R.T.S... Oh, Mr. Roberts we've been expecting you... and here is your keycard to the presidential suite.

B:But there must be some mistake; my reservation was for a standard room.

A: Are you sure? Let me double check .

B:Yeah...Here, this is my confirmation number.

A: You're right Mr. Roberts, there seems to be a **mix-up**, unfortunately we're **overbooked** at the moment.

B:So...

A: Not to worry. We're pleased to offer you a **complimentary upgrade**.

B:Presidential suite baby!

### [4] I need an assistant
A: ... like I told you before, we just don't have the **resources** to hire you an assistant. ... 

B: I understand that, but the fact is we're **understaffed**. 

A: **The timing is just not right**. The economy is bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff. 

B: Yeah, I guess you're right... here's an idea, what if we hire an intern? She would take some of the **weight off my shoulders**. 

A: She? 

B: Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could **give me a hand** with some of these projects and we could **keep our costs down**. 

A: That sounds reasonable... let me see what I can do. 

A: Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant. 

B: OK, great! Let's meet her! 

C: Hi, I'm Adam. 

B: Oh... hi... I'm Tony...

### [5] Cut In Line
A: I can't believe it took us two hours to get here. The traffic in New York is **unbelievable**. 

B: Yeah, but just relax honey, we're here and we're going on vacation. In a few hours **we'll be in Hawaii, and you'll be on the golf course**. 

A: Oh no! Look at that line! It must be **a mile long**! **There's no way** I'm waiting for another two hours. 

B: Honey... don't... 

C: Hey man, the end of the line is over there. 

A: Yeah... 

C: No seriously, I was here first, and you can't **cut in line** like this. 

A: Says who? 

C: I do! 

A: So **sue me**! 

C: Alright... that's it...

### [6] Road Trip
A: So, are we all ready to go? 

B: Yup, I think so. **The car's packed**; we have **munchies** and music, and the map's in the car. 

A: Did you get the camera? 

B: Got it! Did you **fill up the tank**? 

A: Yup, it's all set. 

B: You're sure we're not forgetting anything? 

A: I'm sure... **we've got all our bases covered**. 

B: Well... **let's get going** then! I love road trips! 

B: Um... do you think we can make a **pit stop**? 

A: But we've only been on the road for ten minutes. 

B: I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.
