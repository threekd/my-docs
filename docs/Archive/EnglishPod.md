### [4] I need an assistant
A: ... like I told you before, we just don't have the **resources** to hire you an assistant. ... 

B: I understand that, but the fact is we're **understaffed**. 

A: **The timing is just not right**. The economy is bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff. 

B: Yeah, I guess you're right... here's an idea, what if we hire an intern? She would take some of the **weight off my shoulders**. 

A: She? 

B: Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could **give me a hand** with some of these projects and we could **keep our costs down**. 

A: That sounds reasonable... let me see what I can do.

A: Oh no! Look at that line! It must be **a mile long**! **There's no way** I'm waiting for another two hours. 

B: Honey... don't... 

C: Hey man, the end of the line is over there. 

A: Yeah... 

C: No seriously, I was here first, and you can't **cut in line** like this. 

A: Says who? 

C: I do! 

A: So **sue me**! 

C: Alright... that's it...

---
### [6] Road Trip
A: So, are we all ready to go?

A: Oh great! This stupid computer **froze** again! That's the third time today! Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC? **It's acting up again**. It must have a virus or something. 

B: Just give me a second; **I'll be right up**. 

B: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and **it turns out that** you have a lot of **infected files**! 

A: But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus. 

B: Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly; yours wasn't **up to date**, that's probably what was causing your problems. 

A: Ok. Anything else? 

B: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer! 

A: Um yeah... Sorry about that.

### [8] What's your name again
A: Nick! **How's it going**? 

B: Oh, hey... 

A: What are you doing in this neighbourhood? Do you live around here? 

B: Actually, my office is right around the corner. 

A: It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment. 

B: Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting. You know, **I'm in a bit of a hurry**, but here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion. 

A: Sure, you still have my **contact details**, right ? 

B: You know what, this is really embarrassing, but your name has just **slipped my mind**. Can you remind me?

C: Sure, sorry 'bout that! 

A: Someone's phone is ringing! 

B: Honey, I think it's your phone. Did you forget to **switch it off**?

B: Well, in fact, we're the most expensive **in the market**, so maybe we need to lower our prices to **match the competitors**? 

A: Lower our prices? Not very creative. **It'll never fly** with Swan. What kind of thinking is that? Geez. Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie? 

C: Um, perhaps, um, a **promotion**. Maybe a two-for-one offer, or something like that! 

A: What? That's the same thing. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think! The CEO **will be here any minute**. 

D: Do we have any ideas yet? 

C: Yes Mr. Swan, we were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive. 

D: A two-for-one promotion? Hmm. I kind of like the sound of that. **It sounds like something we should consider**. 

A: Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking! In fact, that's a **brilliant** idea! I'm glad we thought of that. Very creative.

B: Actually, he's a bit strange. I don't know... I've just got **a bad feeling** about him. 

A: Really? Why? 

B: Well, yesterday I brought over a **housewarming gift**, but Armand started acting really **weird**, and then he practically **kicked me out**! I tried to, sort of, peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look. The whole thing really **creeped me out**! 

A: Well, **you'll never guess what I saw** this morning. A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost looked like a coffin! 

B: You see! Why would he... 

C: Hello ladies... 

A: Ah, Armand! You **scared the heck out of me**! This is my friend Doris. 

C: A pleasure to meet you... If you are not doing anything tonight, I would like to have you both for dinner.I mean... I would like to have you both over for dinner.

A: Let's see... These numbers are **off the charts**! What's going on here! 

B: Well, um, sir, the company **expenditures** on entertainment and travel are **out of control**. Look at these bills for example. Just this month we've paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges!

B: The list goes on and on. Here, this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments! 

A: Thank you; that will be all. I'll **take care of** it.

B: Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an **injustice**! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop! We're here to show the government that we don't like the way that they're spending our tax dollars! 

A: Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry? 

B: It's an absolute **outrage**, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers' money to the auto industry. These are companies that have been **mismanaged** and are now nearly **bankrupt**. 

A: I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans. 

B: That maybe true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job, but how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars? And then, they **have the nerve to** fly to Washington in private jets! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars! And they're asking for money! That is just not right! 

A: Good point. This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington D. C., back to you, Tom.

B: It sounds fantastic, but I'm **allergic** to seafood, so...

### [25] Planning For The Worst
A: Well, right, let's move to our next order of business, as many of you are aware, in recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue. And it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan. 

B: Basically, we need to come up with a clear plan; we need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic strikes. 

A: So, what I'd like to do is: first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan; Ralph, I'd like you to head up this project. 

C: Sure, no problem. What issues do you want me to consider? 

B: Well, let's see, there are a few points we need to be thinking about... first, I'll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an outbreak might have. 

A: You'll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected; think of ways to reduce employee-customer contact, perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home. 

C: I guess you'll need me to forecast employee absences as well, right? And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients. Hey, what about vaccines? Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees? 

A: Exactly right. So, I'll leave this to you, and we'll review the draft plan in two weeks. Okay, so, anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?

### [26] New Year Resolution
A: So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution? I've decided to go on a diet.

B: I've heard this one before. 

A: But this time I'm going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time! 

B: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see. 

A: Thanks, honey, that was a great meal. I'm stuffed. Do we have any chips left?
